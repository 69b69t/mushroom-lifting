# mushroom-lifting
this doodad lifts 2 bits of the whole world seed per mushroom tile location. in a perfectly seeded setting you need about 32 mushroom biomes. but i tend to use it for finding really big mushroom biomes. maybe could be used to find huge record seeds but you would need some more magic for that...
run with `cargo run` after changing the positional lines in main.rs
